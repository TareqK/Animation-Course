# Introduction to 3D Modelling Concepts, Techniques, and Tools. 

## What is a 3D object?

In The physical world, a 3d object is an object with length, width, and
depth. All real objects have 3 dimensions.

However, computer screens have only 2 dimensions. How do we achieve 3d 
on a screen? How do we add realism? How do we add immersion?

In computer graphics, we use a computer to generate images to display
that are based on 3d geometric properties. This is a field on its own, but
essentially, it is a visual trick, where shading and outlines give the 
object depth, even though it is on a 2d surface.

We use 3d to convey additional information about an object; all its surfaces,
colours, and textures. We find 3d in many places : education, games, 
animation, CGI, etc.

Information can be communicated through imagery. We have to use the proper
format to convey this. Using the best format efficiently transfers concepts
and relationships and helps us gain new perspectives.

Some uses for 3d modelling and animation: 

1. Computer Graphics.
2. Games and Media.
3. Engineering, Prototyping, and Simulation(physics, chemistry, biology, etc).
4. Medicine.
5. Education.

And many other fields. Using 3d modelling and animation helps us reduce 
costs and speeds up the design/research process.

Although we will be focusing on games, we will be looking at the other
fields. We will be using Blender throughout this course, because it is 
both free(as in freedom) and robust. There are commercial software, 
such as MAYA and 3d Max, but, you know, LICENSING and I am cheap. 



## 3d Modelling Concepts

Our workspace consists of 2 things : 

- A Scene : which is the space were we are working.
- Geometrical axis : X,Y,Z.

There are 3 main steps to animation in blender:

1. 3d Modelling : Modelling the objects shape and textures and colours.
2. Scene layout setup and animation : The motion and placement of objects, 
lights, and cameras in a scene.
3. 3d Rendering : Generating  an image or video from the scene. 

Each Object is made of **points**. These points form **lines**, which 
in turn form **polygons**, which in turn from the Object. These polygons have
**edges**, which are the lines between them. Each object is
a set of data representing the object, usually its shape and textures.


### Types of 3d models 

1. Solid models: Which are models that have internals. they are very 
difficult to create and require a lot of processing power.

2. Shell models: These are just shells without any internals, these 
are easier to create and require less processing power.
